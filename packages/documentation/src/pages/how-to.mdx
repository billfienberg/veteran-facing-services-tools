## How to Add Documents
This is the process of how you should add new pages and documents to this website.

### Adding React Component documentation
Here is how you should add documentation for React Components for Formation. <br />
***Note: An example .mdx can be found at formation-react/src/components/AcceptTermsPrompt***

- Create a .mdx file in the `formation-react/src/components` folder.
- Name it the same name as your React Component.
- Add the required frontmatter at the top of the page
  ```
    ---
    title: AcceptTermsPrompt
    name: AcceptTermsPrompt
    ---
  ```
- Add descriptions to your PropTypes in your Component files

  We need to convert the propType notes to jsDoc format.
  This will not show up in the propTypes definitions in your .mdx file if you
  don't have it in a jsDoc format.

  Here is an examples:

  Current code:
  ```javascript
    YourComponent.propTypes = {
      /* content shown as the actual terms and conditions */
      user: PropTypes.object,

      /* cancel button click handler */
      onCancel: PropTypes.func
    };
  ```

  Changed code:
  ```javascript
    YourComponent.propTypes = {
      /**
       * content shown as the actual terms and conditions
       */
      user: PropTypes.object,
      /**
       * cancel button click handler
       */
      onCancel: PropTypes.func
    };
  ```

  It will look like this on your page once you add these.

### Adding Document Pages
All our documentation should be added to our `src/pages` folder.

- Create a .mdx file
- Add the required frontmatter at the top of the page. You will need this if you
  want it to display in the sidebar.

  ```markdown
    // Your .mdx page
    ---
    title: How to Add Documents
    ---
  ```

This is the only requirements you need to setup your document pages.
