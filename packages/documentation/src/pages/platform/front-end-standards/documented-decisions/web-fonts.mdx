|**Decision Made:**|No| **Decision Date:** | Winter 2019 |

### **GOALS**

- Improving First Contentful Paint
- Improve loading time

**Decision Maker:** @jhonnyoddball and @rianfowler

### **PROPOSED SOLUTIONS**

- Adding `font-display: swap;` to all webfonts to remove FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)
- Splitting the webfonts into their own css and adding them to the head before the main css
- Inline the webfonts into the css
- Encoding the fonts on base64
- Remove hashing from the font names
- Preloading the fonts (hard-coded the 4 needed on the header or dynamically, but can run into problems if they are more than 5 fonts per application)
- Use of [Font Face Observer](https://github.com/bramstein/fontfaceobserver)
