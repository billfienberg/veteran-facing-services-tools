This was the minimal implementation and what I considered to be a good stopping point for the first iteration.\n- Do we want to include them in version control? And if so, will we store images using the commit SHA?\n2. Tests fail on all pages that don't match the baseline\n- This means that intentionally-changed pages are detected as test failures the same as pages that may have been changed visually as an unintended side affect.\n- If we want to plug this into our build pipeline, this will have to be addressed, meaning that we'll need a way for developers to sign off on pages that were intentionally changed.\n3. Does not scroll or resize the browser window\n- This means that with this current implementation, we're only testing it on the desktop viewport. It wouldn't be very difficult to change the window size and take new screenshots as part of the automated tests but I wanted to avoid overkill on the first iteration.\n4. Uses the sitemap to navigate throughout the site\n- Pages not included in the sitemap will not be evaluated by this tool.\n5. Does not interact with the page at all\n- This means that style for elements that are visible only after certain user interactions will not be evaluated."))},n}(o.a.Component),m={}}}]);
