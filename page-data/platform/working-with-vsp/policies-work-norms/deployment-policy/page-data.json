The release is created from <code>master</code> at 2 pm Eastern and deployed at 3 pm Eastern. Code merged to <code>master</code> after 2 pm Eastern will not be added to a release and deployed until the next business day.</p>\n<h2>Exceptions to automated deploys</h2>\n<p>If there are days or periods of time when many people will be out of the office (i.e. holidays) the automated deploys will be suspended. If people aren’t in the office to support the code going out, it’s not responsible to release.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This only applies to <em>automated</em> deploys. Engineer-initiated deploys (e.g. to address a critical bug) will be allowed to proceed as usual.</p>\n<h3>Holiday release freeze schedule</h3>\n<p>Automated deploys will not occur on the following days, due to holidays:</p>\n<h4>2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>9/2 - <strong>Labor Day</strong></li>\n<li>11/11 - <strong>Veterans Day</strong></li>\n<li>11/27 - 11/29 - <strong>Thanksgiving</strong></li>\n<li>12/23 - 1/3/2020 - <strong>Winter holiday freeze</strong> (Note: <em>two weeks</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2020</h4>\n<p><em>Holiday release freeze schedule update coming soon</em></p>\n<h1>Requesting out-of-band deploys</h1>\n<p>If there is a critical issue that needs to be resolved outside the automated deployment schedule (i.e. a bug affecting a large group of users that must be fixed right away), permission must be granted for a manual deploy.</p>\n<p>Extra releases to “just get something out sooner” will not be approved.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You must reach out to Kevin Hoffman who will escalate this request to Chris Johnston for approval.</li>\n<li>To deploy this change to production, the release job is run with the git SHA for the commit to deploy.</li>\n<li>The auto-deploy boolean flag must be set to <code>FALSE</code> on the job.</li>\n<li>The release tag is captured and then used as input for the matching deploy job.</li>\n<li>There are \"special\" jobs for <code>vets-website</code> and <code>vets-api</code> which will run both the release and deploy of <code>master</code> in one operation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Rails database migrations</h1>\n<p>If a Rails database migration is needed for your code to work successfully, that is handled through a separate process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wait for the Jenkins Slack bot to post an <code>Unapplied database migrations</code> notification in <code>#devops-deploys</code>.</li>\n<li>Once the notification has posted, log a request to the DevOps team in the <code>#vetsgov-devops</code> Slack channel, asking them to inspect the changes and run the post-deploy job.</li>\n</ol>","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/deployment-policy.md","title":"Automated Deploys"}}}
