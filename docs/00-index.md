title: Welcome to Formation!
---

The design system (affectionately named “Formation”) is a Fractal implementation for Vets.gov. It’s based on USWDS’ own system, and modified for the unique needs of Vets.gov.

Vets.gov has a collection of components that make up the website. These components have a visual styleguide associated with them, as well as reviewed and refined code that drives them, and best practices for when to use them. Formation is a single source of documentation and truth for people looking to use the Vets.gov components.

Formation’s purpose is to provide accepted guidance for:

- code implementations for existing components
- visual design for existing components
- use guidelines for existing components (when and when not to use a thing)
- implementation of new visual patterns and components
