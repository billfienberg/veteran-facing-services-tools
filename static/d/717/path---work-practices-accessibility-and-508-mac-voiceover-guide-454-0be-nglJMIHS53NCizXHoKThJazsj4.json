Every element should have a blue halo around it as you move through the page. The order that you move through the elements should match the visual hierarchy of the page (ie it shouldn't jump from main content to footer and skip past other important pieces).\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> tab from beginning to end of page watching the focus and order</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2) Navigate by headings should be properly nested and labeled well</h4>\n<p>Imagine you can't see the page and reading out headings was your only way to find the section you're looking for. Headings should be properly nested (no heading level is skipped) and labeled well enough to provide context when navigated outside the context of the page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> open the rotor (VO+U) and arrow to the headings list</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> navigate the page by headings (VO+command+H)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3) Navigate by links</h4>\n<p>Link labels out of context of the rest of the page should be descriptive enough to indicate the destination (no \"click here\"!).</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> open the rotor (VO+U) and arrow to the links list. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>If applicable</h3>\n<h4>4) Check loading messages</h4>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> loading messages should audibly indicate that something is happening.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5) Check tabbed views, pop-ups, modal windows and other interactive elements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> activate any elements that result in a pop-up or modal to make sure they can be accessed and read correctly</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> after using any interactive element, make sure that pressing tab moves to an element that is immediately after where you left off or to an element that’s unsurprising</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6) Make sure all elements that <em>look</em> like form elements are coded as such</h4>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> use VO+U to open rotor and arrow to the form controls list – make sure all elements that look like form elements are on this list</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6) Make sure all form elements can be interacted with</h4>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> tab through all form elements to make sure nothing gets skipped over</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> use enter key to access a drop down or buttons</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> use VO+spacebar to select checkboxes/radio buttons</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"Work Practices/Accessibility and 508/Mac_VoiceOver_guide"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2a08af99-0386-5e1f-9f38-cf8fee178bb4","name":"Work Practices/Accessibility and 508/Mac_VoiceOver_guide"}}
