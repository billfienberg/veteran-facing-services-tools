What are some ideas for doing this on larger teams so it's productive and not mind-numbing?</p>\n<h5>Scrum</h5>\n<p>There have been suggestions to go to 9-day sprints rather than 10, so the last day can be for reporting and planning. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will start sprints on Wednesdays, then do planning and Sprint Reviews on Tuesdays (9 day sprints)</li>\n<li>We host Sprint retros and record the feedback...somewhere</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Kanban</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up WIP limit (can be per person, per discipline, etc). This would just be a starting point that would get modified with team input. Consider using past sprint burndowns to gather insights </li>\n<li>ZH has Kanban reporting but not sure if it is helpful for trying to capture cycle time</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Reporting Structure</h4>\n<p>This will differ for Scrum/Kanban but will still need to happen at regular intervals. What does DSVA currently expect and how often?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use estimates for internal planning purposes but not for reporting; for Scrum we should use broader sprint goals and forecasts</li>\n<li>reports would include a review of tasks planned/completed, blockers, number of defects found or fixed; keep it short and consider two audiences (the sprint team+lead and interested outsiders/CORs). </li>\n<li>For Kanban, a snapshot of the prioritized list then a report on what part of the list got done</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Create reporting channel in slack or email to forward finshed reports for teams - 2 wk cadence</p>\n<p>*Product Health Reporting (how tools are performing against KPIs, trends, feedback)can be more public - monthly</p>\n<h4>Talk priorities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>present any data info associated with the suggested objectives to help target some priorities if it isn't clear</li>\n<li>clarify product ownership</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Team Name??</h4>\n<p>Think about whether you think we should keep it as is or come up with fun ones? Whatever it is, we need to set up labels accordingly so we can hit the ground running and stay organized. There will likely be a larger discussion on this to confirm to try and maintain some harmony.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Platform - Identity, APIs, Insights, Infrastructure</li>\n<li>App Team 1</li>\n<li>App Team 2</li>\n<li>Website</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4>Pre Kick-off</h4>\n<p>We'll use the period between now and the 26th to prepare for the shift, transfer knowledge, and wrap up existing work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>setting KPIs</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Team Kick-off</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Intro all members (who are we)</li>\n<li>Review mission/purpose of the team (why are we here)</li>\n<li>Call out what's in the currently in the portfolio and what the priority will be</li>\n<li>Set the tone (what meetings to expect)</li>\n<li>Feedback about challenges</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Other things to consider:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting up one-on-one with new team members</li>\n<li>separating large groups into smaller, more targeted ones</li>\n<li>Creating a team charter if you see the value</li>\n<li>Cross-team coordination about priorities to ensure we have the right resources for product support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Ben will scrub in to help out Apps Team 2 until we get the PM in place</p>\n<p>Teams will be doing kick-offs the last week of Nov.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nov 26 - official start date</li>\n<li>Nov 27 - Planning</li>\n<li>Nov 28 - Start Sprint</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dec 4 - Outcome Metrics For Success</p>","fields":{"slug":"Work Practices/Team Norms"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8d29caba-3fb1-51cb-81bb-3565d1f17ffc","name":"Work Practices/Team Norms"}}
